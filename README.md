# Translator-Bot
Bot translator. This bot can translate messages on the server into other languages. It can use the Google Translate API

This code sets up the bot and listens for messages. When a user sends a message that starts with !translate, the bot uses the googletrans library to translate the text following the command into the bot's default language. In this example, we're using English as the default language.

Note that this code only supports translating to the default language, but you can modify it to support multiple languages if needed.

Before running the bot, you'll need to replace TOKEN with your bot's token, which you can obtain from the Discord Developer Portal. You'll also need to install the discord and googletrans libraries using pip.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
